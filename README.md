# 🧠 Design Principles

This framework is built around a set of engineering principles that ensure long‑term maintainability, clarity, and enterprise‑grade stability:

- **Single Responsibility** — each class has one clear purpose (BasePage, WebDriverFactory, ConfigManager, BaseApi, etc.).
- **Explicitness Over Magic** — no hidden waits, no implicit behavior; all interactions are intentional, observable, and logged.
- **Fail Fast, Fail Loud** — clear exceptions, structured logging, and isolated per‑test artifacts make failures diagnosable within seconds.
- **Environment Independence** — configuration, drivers, and test data are fully decoupled from the codebase and environment‑specific JSON files.
- **Parallel Safety** — ThreadLocal WebDriver, MDC logging, and isolated artifact directories ensure clean, deterministic parallel execution.
- **Deterministic Behavior** — explicit waits, resilient element lookup, schema validation, and Map‑based API payloads eliminate flakiness.
- **Observability First** — every test produces logs, screenshots, page source, console logs, and Allure metadata for complete traceability.
- **Consistency Across Layers** — UI and API modules follow unified patterns (BasePage/BaseApi, DataProviders, ConfigManager, Allure steps).
- **Scalability First** — architecture supports new modules, environments, API services, and CI/CD pipelines without refactoring.
- **CI Parity** — local and CI execution paths produce identical artifacts, logs, and Allure reports for reliable debugging.

# 🌐 Environment Configuration

This framework uses a JSON‑based configuration system designed for clarity, portability, and CI‑safety. All environment settings are loaded through `ConfigManager`, with optional overrides via system properties. The configuration layer is fully decoupled from the codebase, enabling clean multi‑environment execution across Local, QA, Stage, and Prod.

---

## Key Settings (config.json)

- **browser** — chrome, edge, firefox
- **headless** — GUI mode locally; CI enforces headless automatically
- **baseUrl** — UI application under test
- **apiBaseUrl** — API endpoint base URL
- **timeouts** — explicit wait, page load, and script timeouts
- **remote** — enable Selenium Grid or remote WebDriver execution
- **artifactRoot** — root directory for logs, screenshots, and metadata
- **drivers** — local driver paths (used only when WebDriverManager is disabled)

These settings allow the framework to run consistently across environments without modifying code.

---

## Local vs CI Behavior

Local runs use the values defined in `config.json`, for example:

    "browser": "chrome",
    "headless": false

This results in:

- Full GUI browser execution
- Local developer‑friendly behavior
- Configurable browser selection
- Configurable headless mode

CI runs automatically enforce:

- Headless mode (regardless of config.json)
- Chrome binary path injection (`/usr/bin/google-chrome`)
- ChromeDriver autodetection via WebDriverManager
- Consistent artifact generation (logs, screenshots, page source, console logs)

This ensures:

- GUI mode locally
- Headless mode in CI
- Zero driver mismatches
- Fully stable GitHub Actions execution
- Identical behavior across all environments (CI parity)

---

## Runtime Overrides

Any configuration value can be overridden at runtime using system properties:

    mvn clean test -Dbrowser=edge
    mvn clean test -Dheadless=true
    mvn clean test -Denv=qa
    mvn clean test -Dremote=true -DgridUrl=http://localhost:4444

This allows flexible execution without modifying config files.

---

## Profile‑Aware Configuration

Maven profiles automatically select the correct suite:

    mvn clean test -Pui     # UI suite
    mvn clean test -Papi    # API suite
    mvn clean test -Pall    # Combined UI + API suite

Profiles ensure the framework is:

- Environment‑agnostic
- Profile‑aware
- CI‑ready
- Consistent across local and CI execution

<p align="right"><a href="#selenium-test-automation-framework">⬆️ Back to Top</a></p>

---

# 📂 Test Data Manager

The framework includes a unified, environment‑aware Test Data Manager that centralizes all JSON and CSV test data loading. This ensures consistency, schema validation, and clean separation between test logic and test data across both UI and API layers.

---

## Key Capabilities

### **Environment‑Aware JSON Loading**
`TestDataManager` automatically selects the correct dataset based on the active environment:

- `-Denv=local`
- `-Denv=qa`
- `-Denv=stage`

Example file structure:

    loginData.local.json
    loginData.qa.json

This allows each environment to maintain its own test data without modifying test code.

---

### **CSV + JSON Support**
The manager loads:

- CSV files (e.g., `loginData.csv`)
- JSON arrays and objects (e.g., `loginData.json`)

Both formats are supported by the same unified API, ensuring consistent behavior across all DataProviders.

---

### **Schema Validation**
Every JSON dataset and API response is validated against a matching schema to prevent malformed or drifting data.

**Test Data Schemas**
- `loginData.schema.json`

**API Contract Schemas**
- `post-schema.json`
- `posts-all.schema.json`
- `posts-create.schema.json`
- `posts-single.schema.json`
- `posts-update.schema.json`
- `user-schema.json`
- `comment-schema.json`

This guarantees that both test data and API responses strictly conform to their expected structure.

---

### **Centralized Access**
All tests and DataProviders load data through a single entry point:

    JSONArray loginData = TestDataManager.loadJsonArray("login/loginData.json");

This ensures:

- No duplicated file paths
- No hard‑coded resource lookups
- Consistent behavior across UI + API tests
- Automatic environment routing
- Automatic schema validation

---

## Additional Features

- **Caching Layer** — prevents repeated disk reads during large suites
- **Graceful Error Handling** — clear exceptions when data or schemas are missing
- **Backwards Compatibility** — legacy DataProviders continue to work without refactoring
- **TestNG Integration** — JSON/CSV data can be converted directly into `Object[][]`

---

## Benefits

- Eliminates brittle, scattered file loading
- Guarantees valid test data before execution
- Supports multi‑environment test data strategies
- Reduces maintenance overhead
- Integrates cleanly with TestNG DataProviders
- Ensures API responses match expected contracts
- Provides a single, authoritative source of truth for all test data

The Test Data Manager is now a core part of the framework’s architecture, powering both UI and API test flows with clean, validated, environment‑aware data.

<p align="right"><a href="#selenium-test-automation-framework">⬆️ Back to Top</a></p>

---

# 📜 Schema Validation

The framework includes full JSON Schema validation for both API responses and test data. This ensures structural correctness, prevents regressions, and guarantees that all data consumed by the framework is valid before tests run.

---

## What Schema Validation Covers

### **1. API Contract Validation**

Every API response is validated against a JSON Schema stored under:

    src/test/resources/schemas/

Schemas include:

- post-schema.json
- posts-all.schema.json
- posts-create.schema.json
- posts-single.schema.json
- posts-update.schema.json
- user-schema.json
- comment-schema.json

Used in Contract Tests:

    SchemaValidator.validate("post-schema.json", response.getBody());

This ensures:

- Required fields exist
- Field types match expectations
- No unexpected structural changes occur

---

### **2. Test Data Schema Validation**

All JSON test data is validated before being consumed by tests.

**Test Data Schemas**

- loginData.schema.json

This prevents:

- Missing fields
- Incorrect data types
- Corrupted or drifting test data

---

## How It Works

The `SchemaValidator` uses Everit JSON Schema to validate JSON objects and arrays:

    SchemaValidator.validate("user-schema.json", jsonResponse);

Validation runs:

- During API tests (contract, functional, negative)
- During TestDataManager JSON loading (environment‑aware test data)

If validation fails, the test fails immediately with a clear, readable error message.

---

## Benefits

- Enforces strict API contracts
- Prevents silent data drift
- Catches structural regressions early
- Ensures test data is always valid
- Improves reliability of both UI + API tests

Schema validation is now a core part of the framework’s stability and correctness strategy.

<p align="right"><a href="#selenium-test-automation-framework">⬆️ Back to Top</a></p>

---

# 🧪 API Suite Structure

The API test layer includes a full set of TestNG classes covering functional behavior, CRUD operations, negative scenarios, and JSON Schema contract validation. These tests run through `api-suite.xml` or as part of the combined UI + API suite.

---

## Test Classes

### **1. Functional API Tests**

Covers standard, happy‑path API behavior:

- Status code validation
- JSON field validation
- Response time checks
- Basic contract expectations

Classes include:

- ApiTests
- GetPostsTests

---

### **2. CRUD Operation Tests**

Validates full create/read/update/delete flows for the Posts API:

- CreatePostsTests
- UpdatePostsTests
- DeletePostsTests

These tests use:

- Environment‑aware base URLs
- Schema‑validated request/response bodies
- Centralized API service classes (`PostsApi`, `UsersApi`, `CommentsApi`, `AuthApi`)
- Map‑based payload construction for flexible request building

---

### **3. Negative API Tests**

Covers error and edge‑case behavior:

- Invalid IDs
- Missing resources
- Bad payloads
- Non‑existent endpoints
- Auth failures

Classes include:

- NegativeApiTests
- NegativePostsTests

These tests ensure the API layer handles invalid input safely and predictably.

---

### **4. Contract Tests**

Validates API responses against JSON Schemas:

Schemas include:

- post-schema.json
- posts-all.schema.json
- posts-create.schema.json
- posts-single.schema.json
- posts-update.schema.json
- user-schema.json
- comment-schema.json

Class:

- ContractTests

Ensures structural correctness and prevents regressions across all API endpoints.

---

## How the Suites Run

### **API‑Only Execution**

Triggered via Maven profile:

    mvn clean test -Papi

Runs:

- All functional tests
- All CRUD tests
- All negative tests
- All contract tests

---

### **Combined UI + API Execution**

Triggered via:

    mvn clean test -Pall

Runs:

- Full UI suite
- Full API suite
- Shared reporting + logging (Allure, logs, artifacts)

This provides a complete end‑to‑end validation of both UI and API layers in a single execution path.

<p align="right"><a href="#selenium-test-automation-framework">⬆️ Back to Top</a></p>

---

# 📦 Dependency & Versioning Strategy

The framework uses pinned, stable versions of all critical dependencies to ensure reproducible builds and consistent behavior across environments:

- **Selenium 4.18.1** — stable WebDriver API
- **TestNG 7.10** — parallel execution, retry logic, DataProviders
- **Logback 1.x** — MDC‑based logging with per‑test routing
- **Jackson** — JSON configuration and test data parsing
- **Everit JSON Schema** — schema validation for API contracts and test data
- **WebDriverManager** — automatic driver resolution for local and CI runs

Version upgrades follow a controlled, stability‑first process:

1. Validate compatibility in a feature branch
2. Run the full suite locally (UI + API)
3. Run the full suite in CI (headless Chrome)
4. Review Allure history for regressions
5. Merge only after stability is confirmed

This ensures the framework remains predictable, reproducible, and CI‑safe as dependencies evolve.

<p align="right"><a href="#selenium-test-automation-framework">⬆️ Back to Top</a></p>

---

# 🧪 Test Strategy

The framework follows a layered, enterprise‑grade testing strategy designed for stability, scalability, and diagnosability:

- **UI Tests** validate real user flows across Login, Exceptions, Table, Frames, iFrame, Dynamic Controls, and supporting modules.
- **API Tests** validate REST endpoints using a lightweight API client, Map‑based payloads, schema validation, and status/body assertions.
- **Data‑Driven Tests** ensure broad coverage of positive, negative, and edge‑case scenarios using CSV and JSON datasets.
- **Resilient Interactions** prevent flakiness through explicit waits, retrying click, unified `find()`, and defensive element handling.
- **Parallel Execution** increases throughput and validates thread safety across UI and API layers using ThreadLocal WebDriver and MDC logging.
- **Profile‑Based Execution** allows running UI‑only, API‑only, or combined suites via Maven profiles (`ui`, `api`, `all`).
- **Artifact‑Driven Debugging** ensures every failure is diagnosable through logs, screenshots, page source, console logs, and Allure metadata.
- **Contract Validation** enforces strict API schemas to prevent structural regressions.
- **CI Parity** ensures local and CI runs behave identically, differing only in display mode (GUI vs headless).

This strategy mirrors real enterprise QA practices and ensures both stability and scalability across UI and API layers.

# 🔌 API Architecture

The framework includes a lightweight but powerful API testing layer that is fully integrated with logging, data management, schema validation, and TestNG suite execution. It follows the same architectural principles as the UI layer: clarity, modularity, and maintainability.

---

## Core Components

### **ApiClient**
A reusable HTTP client that supports:

- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- JSON request/response handling
- Automatic header injection
- Request/response logging (MDC‑aware)
- Allure attachments for debugging

---

### **ApiResponse**
A simple wrapper containing:

- statusCode
- headers
- body
- responseTimeMs

Used across all API tests for consistent, readable assertions.

---

### **ApiBaseTest**
Provides:

- MDC test name initialization
- Allure metadata
- Shared setup for all API tests
- Unified logging behavior across UI + API layers

---

### **BaseApi**
A shared parent class for all service classes:

- Centralizes base URLs
- Handles environment‑aware endpoint resolution
- Provides reusable request helpers

---

### **Service Classes**
Each endpoint group has its own dedicated service class:

- UsersApi
- PostsApi
- CommentsApi
- AuthApi (mocked endpoints for negative testing)

These classes encapsulate endpoint URLs and request logic, keeping tests clean and focused on behavior rather than HTTP plumbing.

---

## API Test Types

### **Functional Tests**
Validate:

- Status codes
- Response bodies
- JSON fields
- Basic contract expectations

Classes include:

- ApiTests
- GetPostsTests

---

### **CRUD Tests**
Validate full create/read/update/delete flows:

- CreatePostsTests
- UpdatePostsTests
- DeletePostsTests

---

### **Negative Tests**
Validate:

- Invalid IDs
- Missing resources
- Bad payloads
- Non‑existent endpoints
- Auth failures

Classes include:

- NegativeApiTests
- NegativePostsTests

---

### **Contract Tests**
Validate API responses against JSON schemas:

- post-schema.json
- posts-all.schema.json
- posts-create.schema.json
- posts-single.schema.json
- posts-update.schema.json
- user-schema.json
- comment-schema.json

This ensures structural correctness and prevents regressions.

---

## Integration with the Framework

The API layer is fully integrated with:

- **MDC logging** → per‑test log files
- **TestDataManager** → environment‑aware JSON test data
- **SchemaValidator** → JSON Schema contract enforcement
- **Allure** → request/response attachments
- **TestNG suites** → `api-suite.xml` and `combined-suite.xml`

This creates a unified, enterprise‑grade automation platform across UI + API layers.

---

# 📝 Logging Architecture

This framework includes a production‑grade logging system built with **SLF4J + Logback**, designed for clarity, debuggability, and parallel execution. It uses **Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)** and a **SiftingAppender** to generate clean, isolated logs for every test method across both UI and API layers.

---

## Key Capabilities

- Per‑test log files automatically created in `/logs/<TestName>.log`
- MDC tagging ensures every log line is associated with the correct test (UI or API)
- Thread‑safe logging for parallel TestNG execution
- Action‑level logging from every Page Object method
- Request/response logging for API tests through `ApiBaseTest` and `ApiClient`
- Lifecycle logging from TestListener (start, pass, fail, skip)
- Allure attachments for screenshots, page source, browser logs, API responses, and per‑test logs
- Rolling `framework.log` capturing global framework activity

---

## Step‑Numbered Logging

Every BasePage action is logged with:

- Incrementing step numbers (`[01]`, `[02]`, …)
- Duration tracking for each action (e.g., `(142 ms)`)
- Clean locator formatting (`[id=username]`, `[xpath=//button]`)
- Unified patterns across console, framework.log, and per‑test logs

API tests follow the same MDC pattern, grouping request/response logs under the test’s MDC tag.

---

## Unified Logback Pattern

All logs share a single, modernized pattern including:

- Timestamp
- Log level
- Thread
- MDC test name
- Logger
- Message

This ensures consistent formatting across UI and API logs.

---

## Artifact Integration

The logging system is fully integrated with the artifact pipeline:

- Per‑test logs copied into each test’s artifact directory
- Global logs included in the run‑level summary
- Step‑numbered logs included in zipped artifact bundles
- API tests include request/response logs in their artifact folders
- Retention policy keeps the last 10 runs

This mirrors enterprise‑grade CI/CD debugging workflows.

---

## How MDC Works

Each test method receives a unique MDC value:

    LoginTest.loginDataDrivenTest
    ExceptionsTest.testEditRow1
    ApiTests.getUserDetails

This is set in `BaseTest` and `ApiBaseTest`:

    String testName = this.getClass().getSimpleName() + "." + method.getName();
    MDC.put("testName", testName);

Because MDC is thread‑local, parallel tests never mix logs.

Every log line includes the MDC tag:

    21:34:53.651 INFO  [TestNG-test-All Tests-1] [LoginTest.loginDataDrivenTest] pages.HomePage - Clicking element...
    21:34:53.652 INFO  [TestNG-test-All Tests-2] [ApiTests.getUserDetails] api.ApiClient - Sending GET /users/1

---

## Per‑Test Log Files (SiftingAppender)

Logback’s SiftingAppender automatically routes logs into separate files based on MDC:

    logs/LoginTest.loginDataDrivenTest.log
    logs/ExceptionsTest.testEditRow1.log
    logs/ApiTests.getUserDetails.log

This makes debugging extremely fast—each test has a clean, isolated log.

---

## TestListener Integration

`TestListener` handles:

- Test start/end logging
- Pass/fail/skip events
- Screenshot attachments (UI tests)
- Page source attachments (UI tests)
- Browser console logs (UI tests)
- Per‑test log file attachments
- API request/response logs (API tests)

All lifecycle logs flow through Logback (no System.out.println), ensuring MDC is always applied.

Example lifecycle log:

    [LoginTest.userCanLogoutAfterSuccessfulLogin] listeners.TestListener - === TEST PASSED ===

---

## Page Object & API Action Logging

UI actions log:

- Page class
- Locator
- Action performed
- MDC test name

API actions log:

- HTTP method
- Endpoint
- Request body (if applicable)
- Response status and body
- MDC test name

This produces a readable, step‑by‑step execution trace for every UI and API test.

---

## Framework Log (Rolling File)

A global `framework.log` captures:

- Driver setup
- Navigation
- Environment configuration
- API client initialization
- High‑level framework events

This file rolls daily and keeps 7 days of history.

---

## Why This Matters

This logging system demonstrates:

- Senior‑level automation architecture
- Parallel‑safe design across UI and API layers
- Real‑world debugging practices
- Clean separation of concerns
- CI/CD readiness
- Recruiter‑friendly clarity

It mirrors the logging approach used in enterprise QA automation frameworks.

<p align="right"><a href="#selenium-test-automation-framework">⬆️ Back to Top</a></p>

---

# 📡 API Logging

The framework includes a dedicated API logging layer that captures every request and response with full detail, formatted for readability, and automatically attached to Allure reports. This brings API observability to the same enterprise‑grade level as the UI logging system.

---

## Key Capabilities

### **Pretty‑Printed JSON Logging**

All request and response bodies are automatically formatted using `JsonUtils.toPrettyJson()`, producing:

- Human‑readable JSON
- Indentation and line breaks
- Graceful fallback for non‑JSON payloads

This dramatically improves debugging clarity in both logs and Allure.

---

### **Request + Response Metadata**

Each API call logs:

- HTTP method
- Full URL
- Headers
- Request body
- Response status
- Response time
- Response body

All captured through the centralized `AllureApiLogger`.

---

### **Automatic cURL Generation**

Every API request includes a fully escaped, copy‑ready cURL command:

    curl -X GET "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"

This makes reproducing failures outside the framework effortless.

---

### **Allure Attachments**

Each API call produces the following Allure attachments:

- Request Details
- Response Details
- cURL Command

These appear under the test’s step tree and are included in CI artifacts.

---

### **Configurable Logging Toggle**

API logging can be enabled or disabled via:

**config.json**

    "apiLogging": true

**System property**

    -DapiLogging=false

**.env override**

    apiLogging=false

The `ConfigManager.isApiLoggingEnabled()` method unifies all override paths.

---

### **MDC‑Aware Logging**

API logs are routed through the same MDC test‑name tagging system used by UI tests, ensuring:

- Clean per‑test log files
- Thread‑safe parallel execution
- Unified formatting across UI + API layers

---

## Why This Matters

This enhancement brings the API layer to full enterprise maturity:

- Faster debugging
- Cleaner Allure reports
- Reproducible API calls
- Consistent logging across UI + API
- CI‑ready observability

It also lays the groundwork for future enhancements such as retry logic, authentication flows, and API performance metrics.

# 🧪 CI Pipeline

This project includes a fully automated CI pipeline powered by GitHub Actions. Every push to `main` triggers a complete test run in a clean Linux environment using headless Chrome.

---

## What the Pipeline Does

- Checks out the repository
- Installs JDK 17
- Installs Google Chrome
- Runs the full Maven + TestNG suite in headless mode
- Generates Allure results and Surefire XML reports
- Uploads both as downloadable CI artifacts
- Enforces ChromeDriver autodetection to prevent version mismatches
- Ensures stable, parallel execution in a headless environment

---

## CI Artifacts

Each run produces two downloadable bundles:

- **allure-results.zip** — raw Allure data (steps, logs, screenshots, metadata)
- **surefire-reports.zip** — TestNG XML summaries for debugging

These appear at the bottom of each workflow run under **Artifacts**.

    allure serve target/allure-results

This builds a temporary HTML report and opens it in your browser with:

- Step‑by‑step execution traces
- Screenshots and page source
- Browser console logs
- Per‑test logs
- Environment metadata

---

## CI Allure Report

GitHub Actions automatically:

- Generates Allure results during the test run
- Uploads them as **allure-results.zip** under the **Artifacts** section
- Preserves all attachments (screenshots, logs, metadata)

To view the CI report:

1. Open the latest workflow run
2. Scroll to **Artifacts**
3. Download `allure-results.zip`
4. Extract it locally
5. Run:

       allure serve /path/to/extracted/allure-results

This displays the exact same report generated in CI.

---

## What Allure Provides

- Clean, readable execution history
- Step‑numbered actions from BasePage
- Screenshots on failure
- Page source snapshots
- Browser console logs
- Per‑test log files
- Environment metadata
- Trend graphs (when history is enabled)

Allure makes debugging fast, visual, and production‑grade.

## 📄 Data‑Driven Testing (CSV‑Powered)

This framework uses CSV files to drive the Login module’s positive and negative scenarios through TestNG DataProviders.

---

### How it works

- `loginData.csv` stores all username/password combinations and expected outcomes.
- `CSVUtils` loads the file and converts each row into a map of key/value pairs.
- `LoginDataProvider` feeds each row into the test as an individual execution.
- `LoginTest` validates the login flow using the supplied data.

---

### Example CSV snippet

```csv
username,password,expectedResult
student,Password123,success
student,WrongPassword,failure
wrongUser,Password123,failure
```

# 🏁 How to Run

This framework supports UI tests, API tests, and combined execution through Maven, TestNG, and profile‑based configuration.

---

## Run Full Suite (UI + API)

```
mvn clean test
```

Runs the combined suite using `testng.xml`, applying listeners, parallel execution, and generating Allure results.

---

## Run a Specific Test Class

```
mvn -Dtest=LoginTest test
```

Useful for debugging or validating a single module.

---

## Browser Overrides (UI Tests Only)

```
mvn clean test -Dbrowser=edge
mvn clean test -Dbrowser=firefox
mvn clean test -Dbrowser=chrome
```

---

## Headless Mode

```
mvn clean test -Dheadless=true
```

Ideal for CI pipelines or remote execution.

---

## Execution Methods

| Method | Command / Action | Description |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Maven (Surefire + TestNG)** | `mvn clean test` | Runs the full suite with listeners, parallel execution, and Allure reporting. |
| **UI‑Only Execution** | `mvn clean test -Pui` | Runs only the UI suite (`ui-suite.xml`). |
| **API‑Only Execution** | `mvn clean test -Papi` | Runs API functional, negative, and contract tests. |
| **Combined UI + API** | `mvn clean test -Pall` | Runs both UI and API suites with unified reporting and logging. |
| **TestNG Suite (IDE)** | Right‑click `testng.xml` → Run | Executes the full suite directly from the IDE. |
| **Single Test Class (IDE)** | Run class | Fastest way to isolate a specific module. |
| **Single Test Method (IDE)** | Run method | Ideal for debugging individual scenarios. |
| **System‑Property Overrides** | `mvn clean test -Dbrowser=edge -Dheadless=true -Denv=qa` | Overrides browser, headless mode, and environment at runtime. |
| **Environment‑Specific Test Data** | `mvn clean test -Denv=stage` | Loads JSON/CSV test data from the correct environment folder. |
| **Parallel Execution** | `mvn clean test` *(parallel defined in `testng.xml`)* | Executes tests in parallel using TestNG + Surefire. |
| **Retry‑Enabled Execution** | `mvn clean test -Dretry=true` | Enables RetryAnalyzer + RetryListener for flaky‑test handling. |
| **Remote Execution (Selenium Grid)** | `mvn clean test -Dremote=true -DgridUrl=http://localhost:4444` | Runs tests against a remote WebDriver or Selenium Grid. |
| **Schema Validation** | Included in API + TestDataManager flows | Validates API responses and test data against JSON schemas. |
| **Allure Report (Local)** | `allure serve target/allure-results` | Opens a full Allure report with steps, logs, screenshots, and metadata. |
| **Build Only (Skip Tests)** | `mvn clean install -DskipTests` | Builds the project without executing tests — useful for CI validation or dependency checks. |
| **Debug Logging** | `mvn clean test -Ddebug=true` | Enables verbose logging for troubleshooting WebDriver, API calls, and framework internals. |
| **Custom Config File** | `mvn clean test -Dconfig=custom-config.json` | Loads a specific configuration file instead of the default `config.json`. |
| **Re‑run Failed Tests** | `mvn test -Dsurefire.rerunFailingTestsCount=1` | Automatically re‑runs failed tests once to reduce flakiness. |
| **Generate Allure Report (No Serve)** | `allure generate target/allure-results -o target/allure-report --clean` | Builds the Allure report without launching the UI. |
| **Run Specific Test Groups** | `mvn clean test -Dgroups=smoke` | Executes only tests marked with a specific TestNG group. |

# 🧪 Running Tests with Maven Profiles

This framework includes dedicated Maven profiles that allow you to run UI tests, API tests, or both together. Each profile swaps the active TestNG suite used by Surefire, enabling targeted execution without modifying configuration files.

---

## UI Tests Only
Runs the standard UI automation suite (`testng.xml`):

```
mvn clean test -Pui
```

---

## API Tests Only
Runs only the API tests using the same combined suite, but with browser initialization disabled:

```
mvn test -Papi
```

Includes:
- Functional API tests
- Negative API tests
- JSON Schema contract tests

> **Note:** The framework does not use a separate `api-suite.xml`.  
> API-only execution is handled through profile-based configuration rather than a dedicated TestNG suite.

---

## Combined UI + API Suite
Runs both UI and API tests in a single execution using `combined-suite.xml`:

```
mvn test -Pall
```

Useful for:
- Full regression runs
- CI pipelines
- Unified Allure reporting

---

## Default Behavior (No Profile)
If no profile is specified, Maven uses the **combined suite** and runs **both UI and API tests**:

```
mvn clean test
```

This ensures:
- Consistent local behavior
- Full coverage by default
- No accidental partial runs

---

## Why Profiles Matter
- Clean separation of UI and API layers
- Faster targeted runs during development
- Combined suite for full‑coverage validation
- CI pipelines can choose the appropriate profile
- No need to modify suite files manually
- Supports environment‑aware test data (`-Denv=qa`, `-Denv=stage`, etc.)
- Ensures schema validation runs automatically for API + test data

# 🏗️ How to Run in CI

This framework is fully CI‑ready and supports:

- Multi‑browser execution
- Headless mode
- Environment‑driven configuration
- Allure reporting (results + artifacts)
- Combined UI + API execution by default
- Parallel execution via TestNG
- Retry logic for stabilizing flaky tests

---

## Basic CI Command

```
mvn clean test -Denv=local -Dbrowser=chrome -Dheadless=true
```

This command:

- Forces headless mode (required in most CI runners)
- Loads environment‑specific config and test data
- Runs the combined UI + API suite
- Generates Allure results under `target/allure-results`
- Applies listeners, logging, and parallel execution automatically

---

## CI Notes

- CI pipelines typically install Chrome/Chromium before running tests
- Headless mode is recommended for all CI environments
- Allure results can be published as artifacts or rendered via `allure generate`
- Profiles (`-Pui`, `-Papi`, `-Pall`) can be used for targeted CI jobs
- Retry logic (`-Dretry=true`) can be enabled for unstable environments

# 🤖 AI‑Augmented QA Strategy

Modern QA is rapidly evolving toward AI‑assisted testing, and this framework is intentionally designed to grow alongside those changes. As part of my 60‑day upskilling plan, I am incorporating AI‑augmented QA practices that complement—not replace—traditional automation engineering.

---

## 🌟 How AI Enhances QA
AI is reshaping quality engineering through capabilities such as:

- AI‑generated test cases and scenario expansion
- AI‑driven exploratory testing insights
- Defect clustering and root‑cause pattern detection
- Locator‑healing and flakiness reduction
- Synthetic test data generation
- Risk‑based test prioritization

These enhancements strengthen coverage, reduce maintenance, and accelerate feedback loops.

---

## 📘 My AI‑QA Learning Plan
I am actively following industry‑leading QA organizations to stay aligned with modern testing practices:

- **Coveros** — DevOps/QA research, webinars, and whitepapers
- **TechWell / StickyMinds** — articles, case studies, and conference talks
- **STAR East / STAR West** — keynote sessions on AI in testing

This ensures my AI‑QA approach is grounded in real industry trends.

## 🔧 Future AI Integration Into This Framework
The framework’s clean architecture makes it ideal for future AI‑driven enhancements, including:

- AI‑generated test data feeding into TestNG DataProviders
- AI‑assisted locator healing for dynamic UI changes
- AI‑based flakiness analysis using TestListener logs
- AI‑suggested positive, negative, and edge‑case scenarios
- AI‑enhanced exploratory testing notes and heuristics

These enhancements are planned for future iterations of the framework.
