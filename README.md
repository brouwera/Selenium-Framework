This project demonstrates real-world automation engineering skills, not just basic Selenium usage:

- **Scalable architecture** using Page Object Model and layered design
- **Stable, flake‑resistant tests** built with explicit waits and clean synchronization
- **Data-driven testing** powered by CSV utilities and TestNG DataProviders
- **Thread-safe WebDriver management** using a BaseTest + ThreadLocal design
- **CI/CD integration** with GitHub Actions for automated, headless execution

## 📄 Data‑Driven Testing (CSV‑Powered)

This framework uses CSV files to drive login scenarios through TestNG DataProviders. Test logic stays clean and focused while the data lives in a simple, editable file.

### How it works
- `loginData.csv` stores all username/password combinations and expected outcomes.
- `CSVUtils` loads the file and converts each row into a map of key/value pairs.
- `LoginDataProvider` feeds each row into the test as an individual execution.
- `LoginTest` validates the login flow using the supplied data.

### Example CSV snippet
```csv
username,password,expectedResult
student,Password123,success
student,WrongPassword,failure
wrongUser,Password123,failure
```

---

# 📌 Current Scope (Aligned With the Real UI)

The Practice page currently includes:

- **Test Login Page**
- **Test Exceptions**
- **Test Table** (coming soon)

Removed modules (no longer present on the site):

- Test Inputs
- Test Alerts

This keeps the framework aligned with the real application under test.

---

# 🏁 How to Run

### Run full suite:

mvn clean test

### Run a specific test:

mvn -Dtest=LoginTest test

### **Execution Methods Overview**

| Execution Method | Command | Description |
|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Maven (Surefire + TestNG Suite)** | `mvn clean test` | Executes the entire suite using `testng.xml`, applies listeners, parallel execution, and generates Allure results. |
| **TestNG Suite (IDE Run)** | Right‑click `testng.xml` → Run | Runs the suite directly from the IDE with all listeners and parallel settings applied. |
| **Single Test Class** | Run test class in IDE | Useful for debugging or validating a specific module without running the full suite. |
| **Single Test Method** | Run method in IDE | Fastest way to isolate and debug a specific scenario. |
| **Allure Report** | `allure serve target/allure-results` | Generates and opens a full Allure report with steps, attachments, retries, and labels. |

This completes the documentation milestone for Day 15 and prepares the framework for upcoming multi‑environment and stability enhancements.

### **Day 16 — Parallel Execution + TestNG Suite Integration**
Today’s focus was on scaling the framework for real‑world execution patterns. I introduced a dedicated `testng.xml` suite file and configured Maven Surefire to run the suite directly. This allowed the framework to support parallel execution, listener registration, and structured test grouping.

**Key Achievements**
- Added `testng.xml` with suite, test, and listener configuration
- Enabled parallel execution (`parallel="methods"`, `thread-count=2`)
- Verified stable parallel runs across all Login tests
- Ensured Allure reporting works seamlessly with suite‑based execution
- Cleaned up test grouping (`smoke`, `regression`) for CI‑ready organization

**Outcome:**  
The framework now executes tests in parallel with clean reporting, predictable structure, and full listener support — a major step toward CI/CD readiness.

---

### **Day 17 — Retry Logic, Listener Architecture, and Stability Validation**
Today I implemented a professional‑grade retry mechanism using TestNG’s `IRetryAnalyzer` and `IAnnotationTransformer`. This included wiring a custom `RetryListener` and integrating flaky‑test labeling into Allure.

After validating the architecture, I removed the intentional failure and restored the suite to full stability.

**Key Achievements**
- Added `RetryAnalyzer` and `RetryListener` for controlled retry logic
- Integrated flaky‑test labeling and retry steps into Allure
- Ensured listeners load correctly through `testng.xml`
- Restored parallel execution after validation
- Achieved a fully stable, 100% passing suite with clean Allure reporting

**Outcome:**  
Retry logic is now part of the framework’s architecture — available when needed, invisible when not. The suite runs cleanly in parallel with zero flakiness and full reporting fidelity.

---

### **Day 18 — Exceptions Module + Full Framework Polish**
Today’s focus was on expanding the framework beyond login testing by implementing the full Exceptions module and validating it end‑to‑end. This included building a complete Page Object, creating five exception‑focused test cases, and performing a full consistency sweep across the entire project.

**Key Achievements**
- Added `ExceptionsPage` with full support for delayed elements, dynamic DOM changes, disabled inputs, and short‑timeout behavior
- Implemented `ExceptionsTest` with five real‑world exception scenarios: NoSuchElementException, ElementNotInteractableException, InvalidElementStateException, StaleElementReferenceException, and TimeoutException
- Ensured all interactions use explicit waits and Allure step annotations for clarity and reporting
- Performed a full framework polish to align formatting, naming, comments, and structure across all modules
- Executed the entire suite (8 Login tests + 5 Exceptions tests) with **100% passing results** and no flakiness
- Updated README with a dedicated CSV‑Driven Testing section to document the data layer of the framework

**Outcome:**  
The Exceptions module is now fully integrated, stable, and production‑ready. The framework has grown from a single‑module login suite into a multi‑module automation project with clean architecture, consistent style, and complete documentation.

---

### **Day 19 — Exceptions Module Enhancements + Framework Consistency Upgrades**
Today’s work focused on elevating the Exceptions module from “functionally complete” to “architecturally consistent” with the rest of the framework. This meant aligning all Page Object interactions with the BasePage API, expanding BasePage with missing universal helpers, and refining the exception‑simulation test to behave exactly as Selenium does in real‑world scenarios.

A key part of today’s work was ensuring that the framework could intentionally reproduce Selenium exceptions *without* compromising the safety and consistency of normal interactions. To achieve this, a new `rawClick()` method was added to BasePage, allowing the framework to bypass wait conditions only when explicitly required for exception testing.

**Key Achievements**
- Added three foundational helpers to `BasePage` (`clear`, `getAttribute`, `isElementPresent`) to ensure full consistency across all Page Objects
- Introduced `rawClick()` to safely simulate Selenium exceptions without affecting standard click behavior
- Updated `ExceptionsPage` to use the new helpers and expose a clean `clickInvisibleSaveButton()` method for controlled exception testing
- Updated `ExceptionsTest` to rely solely on Page Object methods, maintaining proper encapsulation and avoiding protected BasePage calls
- Validated all five exception scenarios with accurate Selenium behavior, including the corrected `ElementNotInteractableException` test
- Executed the full suite with **100% passing tests** and verified clean Allure reporting
- Confirmed Allure report generation via both Maven (`allure:aggregate`) and CLI (`allure serve target/allure-results`)

**Outcome:**  
The Exceptions module is now fully aligned with the framework’s architecture, using consistent BasePage utilities and clean Page Object abstractions. Exception simulation is accurate, intentional, and isolated, while normal test flows remain safe and stable. With all enhancements complete, the framework now demonstrates production‑grade consistency, clarity, and maintainability across every module.
